# üîì Disable Vercel Deployment Protection

## The Problem
Your app's API endpoints are being blocked by Vercel's deployment protection, preventing results from displaying.

## Quick Fix (2 Options)

### Option 1: Disable Protection via Vercel Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project: **5g-availability-checker**
3. Click **Settings** (top menu)
4. Scroll down to **Deployment Protection**
5. Select **"Standard Protection"** or **"Disabled"** instead of current setting
6. Click **Save**

### Option 2: Use Vercel CLI

```bash
cd /Users/vinayak/AI/5g-availability-checker
vercel env ls
```

## Why This Happens

Vercel's deployment protection requires authentication for:
- Preview deployments
- Production deployments (if enabled)

This blocks:
- ‚ùå API calls from your frontend
- ‚ùå External access
- ‚ùå Testing

## After Disabling Protection

Your app will work immediately - just refresh the page!

The API endpoints will return JSON data instead of the authentication page.
