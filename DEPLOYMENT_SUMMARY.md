# üîß Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå WebSocket Not Supported on Vercel
**Problem**: Your frontend was using WebSocket connections (`/ws` and `/ws_fromdata`), but Vercel's serverless functions don't support WebSockets.

**Solution**: Updated `templates/form.html` to use REST API endpoints instead:
- Changed `startWebSocketLive()` to use `/api/check-live`
- Changed `startWebSocketFromData()` to use `/api/check-from-database`

### 2. ‚ùå Missing Dependencies
**Problem**: `requirements-vercel.txt` was missing the `overpy` package needed for geocoding.

**Solution**: Added `overpy==0.7` to `requirements-vercel.txt`

### 3. ‚ùå CSV Files Not Deployed
**Problem**: The `results.csv` and `result10.csv` files weren't being included in the Vercel deployment.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `vercel.json` with `includeFiles: "*.csv"`
- Added CSV files as static builds in `vercel.json`
- Created `.vercelignore` to explicitly allow CSV files
- Enhanced file loading logic in `app.py` to check multiple paths including `/var/task/` (Vercel's directory)

### 4. ‚ùå Poor Error Handling
**Problem**: The API endpoints weren't providing helpful error messages when things went wrong.

**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive logging throughout `app.py`
- Improved error handling in `/api/check-from-database`
- Added fallback behavior when geocoding fails
- Enhanced database loading with better path resolution

## Files Changed

### 1. `requirements-vercel.txt`
```diff
+ overpy==0.7
```

### 2. `vercel.json`
- Added CSV files to builds
- Added `includeFiles` configuration
- Configured static file handling

### 3. `.vercelignore` (NEW)
- Ensures CSV files are not ignored during deployment

### 4. `templates/form.html`
- Replaced WebSocket code with fetch API calls
- Updated `startWebSocketLive()` to use REST API
- Updated `startWebSocketFromData()` to use REST API

### 5. `app.py`
- Enhanced CSV file loading with multiple path attempts
- Improved error handling in API endpoints
- Added fallback behavior for geocoding failures
- Better logging for debugging

## How to Deploy

### Quick Deploy
```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /Users/vinayak/AI/5g-availability-checker

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Verify Deployment

1. **Check Health**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.vercel.app/health
   ```
   Expected: `"status": "healthy"` and `"results_count" > 0`

2. **Check Database**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/database-status
   ```
   Expected: `"database_ready": true` and `"address_count" > 0`

3. **Test API**:
   ```bash
   curl "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/check-from-database?n=5"
   ```
   Expected: JSON with results array containing addresses

4. **Test UI**:
   - Visit `https://your-app.vercel.app/`
   - Enter an address (e.g., "340 Lygon Street Carlton VIC")
   - Click "Check from Database"
   - You should see results!

## Debugging

### If No Results Appear

1. **Check Vercel Logs**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Click "Deployments" ‚Üí Latest deployment
   - Check "Functions" tab for logs

2. **Check Debug Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.vercel.app/debug
   ```
   Look for:
   - `csv_files` array should include "results.csv"
   - `app_state.results_count` should be > 0
   - `working_directory` shows where the app is running

3. **Common Issues**:
   - **CSV not found**: Check that `results.csv` is in your git repository
   - **Empty database**: Check the debug endpoint to see if files are loaded
   - **Geocoding fails**: The app has fallback logic to show sample data

## Local Testing

To test locally before deploying:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
uvicorn app:app --reload

# Test in browser
open http://localhost:8000

# Test API
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/check-from-database?n=5"
```

## Features Available on Vercel

### ‚úÖ Works
- Web interface
- Database checking (from CSV)
- Map visualization (from cached data)
- Dashboard
- REST API endpoints

### ‚ùå Disabled
- Live Selenium-based checking (returns mock data)
- WebSocket connections (replaced with REST APIs)
- Bulk checking with Selenium

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: Run `vercel --prod`
2. **Verify**: Check the health endpoint
3. **Test**: Try the UI with "Check from Database"
4. **Monitor**: Watch Vercel logs for any issues

## Important Notes

- The "Check Live Availability" button will return mock data on Vercel (since Selenium isn't available)
- Use "Check from Database" for real results from your CSV file
- Make sure `results.csv` is committed to your git repository
- Vercel has a 50MB limit for serverless functions
- The app logs extensively - check Vercel logs if anything goes wrong

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check `/health` endpoint first
2. Check `/debug` endpoint for file information
3. Review Vercel function logs
4. Ensure CSV files are in your repository

**Status**: ‚úÖ All fixes applied and ready for deployment
**Local Test**: ‚úÖ App imports successfully with 2078 addresses loaded
**Next Action**: Deploy to Vercel with `vercel --prod`
