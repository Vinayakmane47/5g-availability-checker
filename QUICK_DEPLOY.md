# 🚀 Quick Deploy to Vercel

## What Was Fixed
Your app wasn't showing results because:
1. ❌ Vercel doesn't support WebSockets → ✅ Replaced with REST APIs
2. ❌ Missing `overpy` dependency → ✅ Added to requirements
3. ❌ CSV files not included → ✅ Configured vercel.json
4. ❌ Poor error handling → ✅ Added logging and fallbacks

## Deploy Now (3 Steps)

### 1️⃣ Commit Changes
```bash
cd /Users/vinayak/AI/5g-availability-checker
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel: WebSocket→REST, add CSV files, improve errors"
git push
```

### 2️⃣ Deploy to Vercel
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### 3️⃣ Test Your App
After deployment, Vercel gives you a URL. Open it and:
1. Go to `https://your-app.vercel.app/`
2. Enter: "340 Lygon Street Carlton VIC"
3. Click: **"Check from Database"**
4. See results! 🎉

## Quick Verification

```bash
# Replace with your actual URL
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/health

# Should show:
# "status": "healthy"
# "results_count": 2078
```

## ⚠️ Important
- ✅ Use "**Check from Database**" - works perfectly
- ❌ "Check Live Availability" returns mock data (Selenium not available on Vercel)
